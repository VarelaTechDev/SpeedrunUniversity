Use percentages for widths NOT FIXED PIXELS

Use em for fonts

rem: root
em: as is <--- Problem when we nest things

Process not defined error?

Update this to 5.0.0 to resolve the issue
npm install react-scripts@latest


CSS position
A parent is needed >> p
A child follows under it >> c

Static: 
    follow the flow of other elements --> 1,2,3,4 You expect the element to go with that order

Relative: 
    Nearly the same as static
    Can change the top/left/right/bottom
    left: 10px <-- Left side is 10px away from the left
    Overflows!
    Won't push around static elements

    ? Now we have to move all of this down, so position relative isn't really used for top/left/right/bottom
    USEFUL to set an element relative as a parent for absolute

Relative <--> Absolute work together well

Absolute: Place posistion: absolute in child-one
    A ghost block?
    The other child IGNORE this
    Treat it like it doesn't even exist
    Good for when you want to stick something to it 
    top? ABSOLUTE POSITION OF THE PARENT CONTAINER
    The parent? Nope, it's static --> Need a position : realtive, aboslute, stiicky, fixed
    Now we have realtive a use case

Fixed: Nearly the same as absolute
    Ignores the parent element -- Even if they have a relative posisition

    FIXED to the entire HTML page
    Stays at the same place when we scroll

Sticky: Combination of relative/fixed into one
    A mini dynamic fixed position
    It's relative by default and becomes fixed when we scroll down

How to Deploy
=========================================================================================
Heroku:: 

Create new app
Put a name and now Heroku Git

sudo snap install --classic heroku

$ heroku login


Paste this in the VSCode Terminal
heroku git:remote -a snippet-managerserver
[Push to this remote to run it]
git push heroku master

Create a new Git repository

Initialize a git repository in a new or existing directory

$ cd my-project/
$ git init
$ heroku git:remote -a snippet-managerserver

Deploy your application

Commit your code to the repository and deploy it to Heroku using Git.

$ git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
$ git push heroku master

Just create a new repo and follow the directions...
Go to more and view logs
Now we have .env errors...

Go to settings to set .env variables

Go to settings and click Config Vars and click More --> Now click reset all dynos
add 
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000
Heroku will have the port for us

Now our app is now running online now

FRONTEND:: NOW WE TRY TO UPLOAD THE FRONTEND TO Netlify

Don't want to just drop the Client file
We create a build folder :: npm run build

Site settings to change the name at least

Production environment and development environment
process.env.NODE_ENV

IN src/create util folder and create domain.js
export default process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? "http://localhost:5000" : process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && "https://[website]].herokuapp.com"

By default it's already in development mode


Go to Netlify and to Build & Deploy

Go to Environment
NODE_ENV --> production

Rebuild it and upload it

Blocked from CORS...
In index.js
origin has only localhost:3000


Now we need to set more security settings for cookies
Didn't see the problem with the cookie
Seems fine on FireFox, but not with Chrome

Go to userRouter.js for our cookie settings
By default it is lax

sameSite: 'none' ADD SECURE: true

Security RISK!!!

        res.cookie('token', token, {
            httpOnly: true,
            sameSite: 'none',
            secure: true
        }).send()
Only allows https 

HTTPS encrypts it if someone reads it
https, means it will not work locally....

Now go to Heroku and do NODE_ENV = production

When ever we make changes to the server
git commit -am "ASASASASAS"
git push heroku master


For frontend/client
npm run build
Upload to Deploys the build folder

Mini CSS ERROR??? 2.5 breaks things
npm i -D --save-exact mini-css-extract-plugin@2.4.5

Now clear the cookie

We have the same database with development and production :: Care

=================================================================================
SASS #15 Media Queries
=================================================================================
We want to have it adopt depending on what screen size we have

Create a map of different breakpoints
$breakpoints:(
    'xs': 0,
    'sm': 480px,
    "md": 720px,
    "lg": 960px
)

@mixin xs {
    @media(min-width: map-get($breakpoints, 'xs')){
        @content; // If we use this Mixin elsewhere <-- Dont want to recode it>
    }
}


How to use it??
@xs {
    font-size: 10px; // <-- Place what ever properties we want>
    background-color: red;
}


Import the breakpoints --> @import 'breakpoint'
